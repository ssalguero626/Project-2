# Project-2

WEB application that serves to share information about 311 calls in NYC. I would like to visualize the most common type of 311 calls made NYC, along with which agency receives the most calls and map the density of 311 calls in NYC.

Being a native of the New York Metro Area and seeing the immense amount of data it generates, I am looking to tell a story of the most common types of 311 non violent complaints NYC receives. Which area of the city these complaints are most reported in and see which type of agengy gets the most complaints. I would like to visualize this using data directly from the NYC gov and using various data tools and programming languages to accomplish this.
